ðŸ“Š Real-Time Reddit Sentiment Analyzer using Kafka and Python
This project performs real-time sentiment analysis on Reddit posts using Python, Apache Kafka, and TextBlob. It streams posts from a specified subreddit using Reddit's API and publishes them to a Kafka topic. A Kafka consumer then processes each post, analyzes its sentiment, and logs the results to a CSV file.
